/*

This process doesn't need a separate file. However, we need a placeholder file
as processes in general need implementation files in which the parameters of the 
cell process can be placed.

The values in the Cell Process for the Passive conductance are used by the 
GENESIS Morphology Generator when it creates the *.p file

See GENESISMorphologyGenerator.java, or one of the generated *.p files for a cell
with a leak current
