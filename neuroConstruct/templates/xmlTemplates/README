The Examples and Schema directories are taken from the standard NeuroML distribution.

To get the latest version of these, remove the Examples and Schema dirs, and use the following commands 
in this directory to get the latest versions from the NeuroML SVN repository:

svn co https://neuroml.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/neuroml/trunk/web/NeuroMLFiles/Examples/ Examples
svn co https://neuroml.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/neuroml/trunk/web/NeuroMLFiles/Schemata/ Schemata

If you have checked out the neuroConstruct source code from the neuroConstruct SVN repository, you 
should be able to run ./updatenC.sh (Linux/Mac) or updatenC.bat (Windows) to update all of the required 
files from the different repositories for a single consistent set of code/examples/NeuroML files, etc.

The ChannelMLPrototypes directory outlines how some of the examples can be incorporated 
as templates for channels in neuroConstruct

The other files in this dir are remnants of older methods of creating channels in 
neuroConstruct and can be ignored...
