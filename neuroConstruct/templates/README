This directory contains some useful files for GENESIS and NEURON.

The xxxTemplate directories contain some simple mod/GENESIS script files for making basic channels/synaptic mechanisms. 
These have been largely superceded by ChannelML based templates (apart from templates for stimulations).

The xxxUtils directories contain some handy utility functions for use within GENESIS/NEURON. See the files for details.

The xmlTemplates dir contains examples and schema docs for NeuroML. These are used to load ChannelML templates into neuroConstruct.
