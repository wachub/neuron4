This folder contains a number of examples of NeuroML 2 compliant files, the definition of the core NeuroML 2 
components using LEMS, and a utility, nml2, which wraps the LEMS Interpreter to add greater support for NeuroML 2
and import/export options for converting LEMS models to/from other formats. 

    Quick start (Windows):

  Type "make" to build the main libNeuroML jar file
  Type "nml2 examples\LEMS_NML2_Ex2_Izh.xml" to see a simple example running
  If you have Apache Ant installed, build with "ant" or run individual examples with "ant nml2_5", etc. or
  try "ant test" to run a battery of tests

    Quick start (Linux/Mac):

  Type "./make" to build the main libNeuroML jar file
  Type "./nml2 examples/LEMS_NML2_Ex2_Izh.xml" to see a simple example running
  If you have Apache Ant installed, build with "ant" or run individual examples with "ant nml2_5", etc. or
  try "ant test" to run a battery of tests


It is advisable to add the environment variable NML2_HOME to your system pointing to this directory, and 
then add NML2_HOME to your PATH. This will allow the nml2 utility to be used from any directory, and allow
it to find the NeuroML 2 Component definition files in NeuroML2CoreTypes.
