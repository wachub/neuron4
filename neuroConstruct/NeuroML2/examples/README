Examples of NeuroML v2alpha files and some LEMS files for executing them with the LEMS Interpreter

Files starting with NML2_ are "pure" NeuroML 2 files and are intended for use with any compatible 
NeuroML 2 compliant application. They are all compliant to the NeuroML v2alpha schema at ../Schemas/NeuroML2/NeuroML_v2alpha.xsd

Files starting with LEMS_NML2 contain LEMS code (for locating the NeuroML 2 core component definitions and for 
specifying simple simulations), and some NeuroML 2 elements or import NeuroML 2 files. These can all be executed 
in the LEMS Interpreter/nml2 utility. Go to the parent folder and try:

    nml2.bat examples\LEMS_NML2_Ex0_IaF.xml         (Windows)
    ./nml2 examples/LEMS_NML2_Ex0_IaF.xml           (Linux/Mac)

or if you have Ant installed try:

    ant nml2_0

etc.
