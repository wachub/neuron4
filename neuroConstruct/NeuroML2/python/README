This is an initial attempt to create a LEMS & NeuroML 2 API for Python (libNeuroML).

Install the Python module using: 

	python setup.py install

Module lxml is required. Install using easy_install or your package manager.

You will have to add the environment variable NML2_HOME, pointing to the dir with
the main libNeuroML jar file (usually the parent directory of this directory) where
the nml2 utility is found. Also add this dir to your PATH. This is to allow the
Python scripts to execute nml2 (or nml2.bat on Win). It's also useful for running
nml2 manually from any other folder.

Go in to examples dir and run one of the examples, e.g.:

	python run_adex.py
