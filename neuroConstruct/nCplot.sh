#     
#    A convenient script for plotting data files, etc. using the neuroConstruct 
#    graphing window. Can be used with any file format which can be imported into 
#    neuroConstruct via Tools -> Import Data for Plot, i.e. time series data in 
#    one or more columns
#    
#    Might be useful to associate some file types with nCplot.bat, e,g, *.dat so
#    That double clicking on them plots them 
#

~/neuroConstruct/nC.sh -plot $*
