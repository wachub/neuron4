This is a distribution of neuroConstruct, software for developing 3D networks for 
biologically realistic neuronal simulations.    

More information can be found at: http://www.neuroConstruct.org

The application can be run via the desktop/Start Menu links if the automatic
installers have been used, or in a terminal with nC.bat (Windows) or ./nC.sh (Linux/Mac),
after Java has been installed.
