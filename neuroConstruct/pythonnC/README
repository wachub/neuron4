
These are some example files for interacting with neuroConstruct through the Python interface.


****   BETA stage of implementation. 

The interaction is achieved using Jython.

The scripts can be run using the nC script files, e.g. type:

..\nC.bat -python Ex1_Simple.py         (Windows)
../nC.sh -python Ex1_Simple.py          (Linux/Mac)

All of the required libraries for Jython should be included with the standard neuroConstruct distribution.

NOTE: currently Jython complies with Python 2.2 (v2.5 is the current version of C Python), so some 
Python modules may not be supported
